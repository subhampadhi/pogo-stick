# Pogo Stick: A Node.js Load Balancer and Proxy Server with an Interactive UI

## Introduction
Pogo Stick is an ambitious project with a vision to bring the power of load balancing and proxying to Node.js developers in a user-friendly and visually appealing way. Built with TypeScript, Pogo Stick aims to simplify the complexities of load balancing and proxying with an intuitive UI, while providing essential features such as logging, routing, forwarding, load balancing algorithms, caching, and authentication. This project is fueled by the excitement of learning and experimenting with Node.js and TypeScript, making it a perfect playground for hobbyist developers.

## Features for Effortless Load Balancing
Pogo Stick aims to include a wide range of features that make it a breeze to configure and manage load balancing and proxying:

- Logging: Keep track of traffic patterns, errors, and performance metrics with Pogo Stick's logging capabilities. Easily view and analyze logs to gain insights into your applications' behavior.
- Routing: Define routing rules with ease using Pogo Stick's interactive interface. Set up URL patterns, HTTP methods, headers, and query parameters with a few clicks, making it simple to route incoming requests to the appropriate backend servers.
- Forwarding: Distribute incoming requests across backend servers with Pogo Stick's forwarding capabilities. Choose from various forwarding strategies to balance the load effectively.
- Load Balancing: Pogo Stick aims to offer a range of load balancing algorithms, including round-robin, least connections, and IP hash, to distribute requests evenly and ensure smooth performance across backend servers.
- Caching: Improve performance by caching frequently requested resources with Pogo Stick's caching capabilities. Reduce backend server load and speed up response times.
- Authentication: Secure your applications and APIs with authentication methods such as OAuth, JWT, and basic authentication. Pogo Stick aims to make it easy to configure authentication settings and keep your applications protected.

## User-Friendly UI for Easy Configuration
Pogo Stick's vision includes an intuitive and interactive user interface that makes it a pleasure to configure and manage load balancing and proxying settings. With a visually appealing drag-and-drop interface, you will be able to easily set up data sources, routing rules, load balancing algorithms, and authentication settings. The UI will provide real-time feedback and visualizations, making it a delightful experience to configure and monitor your load balancing setup.

## Future Possibilities
Pogo Stick is a project with endless possibilities for further enhancements and adventures. Some of the exciting future plans include:

- More Load Balancing Algorithms: Pogo Stick aims to expand its collection of load balancing algorithms to provide more options for developers to fine-tune their load balancing strategies.
- Data Source Integration: Pogo Stick plans to support integration with various data sources and databases, such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis, to further enhance its capabilities.
- Enhanced Monitoring and Analytics: Pogo Stick aims to provide advanced monitoring and analytics features, including real-time traffic visualization, performance metrics, and alerting, to help developers gain deeper insights into their load balancing setup.
- SSL Termination and Encryption: Pogo Stick plans to add support for SSL termination and encryption, allowing developers to secure their communication with SSL certificates and encryption options.
- Customizable Error Handling: Pogo Stick aims to provide customizable error handling options, allowing developers to customize error pages and error management settings to match their unique requirements.
- Authentication and Authorization Options: Pogo Stick plans to support additional authentication and authorization options, such as integration with OAuth providers, LDAP, and SAML, to offer more flexibility and security options for developers.
